# üìä Mental Health in Tech ‚Äî Analysis Summary
### Goal & Scope

This analysis explores mental health in the technology sector, using survey data to understand:
- Demographics of respondents.
- Prevalence and diagnosis of mental health disorders.
- Comfort levels in discussing mental health in the workplace.
- Employer support and stigma-related factors.

The goal was to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization while drawing actionable insights about workplace mental health.


### üîë Key Findings

**Demographics**
- Age skewed toward younger working professionals.
- Gender imbalance in respondents (tech-heavy male representation).
  - Majority respondents aged 18‚Äì35 (‚âà65%).
  - Gender imbalance: ~70% male, ~25% female, ~5% non-binary/other.

**Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders**
- Significant proportion of respondents (Approx 40%) reported experiencing or being diagnosed with a mental health condition.
- Many reported interference of mental health with daily work and productivity.

**Workplace Comfort & Stigma**
- Respondents were less comfortable discussing mental health with employers/supervisors (~35%) compared to coworkers or family/friends (~70%). 
- Stigma and fear of negative career consequences remained a barrier.

**Employer Support**
- 70% agreed employers supported physical health, but only 40% agreed on mental health support.

**Trends Across Surveys (2017 vs 2019)**
- Gradual improvement in willingness to discuss mental health at work.
- Some positive shifts in employer recognition of mental health importance.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è One Chart to Rule them all
These two charts show the perceived relationship between the importance of physical and mental health, and the levels of industry support for mental health:

First chart:
- In both years (2017 in red, 2019 in blue), responses cluster strongly in the mid-to-high importance range (around values 4‚Äì8).
- The diagonal line represents a one-to-one relationship‚Äîwhere mental health is rated as equally important as physical health. Points below the line indicate that employers place greater importance on physical health relative to mental health.
- A higher concentration of data falls below the line, suggesting that employers tend to prioritize physical health over mental health.

Second chart:
- This chart shows the distribution of perceived industry support for mental health on a scale from 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High).
- The distributions are nearly identical between 2017 and 2019, indicating no meaningful progress over this period. The median value remains below 3, reflecting generally low levels of perceived support.

### üìå Key Takeaways
- Workplace stigma persists: Mental health conversations are still riskier with managers than with peers.
  - Only ~1 in 3 respondents feel safe disclosing to supervisors. 
- Support gap: Employers provide more visible support for physical health than mental health.
  - Employers are 30pp more likely to be seen as supporting physical health vs. mental health. 
- Need for policies: Training, clear policies, and cultural changes are necessary to normalize mental health discussions.
- Data-driven monitoring: Continued survey analysis is vital to track progress over time.


## Limitations of the Data
There were a number of limitations with the dataset:

- Limited Data:
  - The number of respondents varied wildly between 2014 and 2016 
- Lacking Consistency
  - Many fields lack consistent responses over tine making year to year comparisons difficult
- Stale Data
  - The latest survey responses were from 2019 which is a full 6 years ago. 
  - Many events have happened since this data was collected such as Covid-19, Working From Home culture which would have greatly affected tech workers.
  - This makes this data much less applicable for current day insights.
