    "# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goal & Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to identify which factors most strongly influence perceived red wine quality. The focus is on developing an explanatory model to understand these relationships, rather than a predictive model aimed at forecasting quality scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚰 Data Source\n",
    "- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Null Hypothesis** :\n",
    "There is no linear relationship between wine quality and the predictor variables (alcohol, sulphates, volatile acidity, and density)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interpretation & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the regression output, the coefficients for alcohol, sulphates, and volatile acidity are statistically significant (p < 0.05). This provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore we reject H₀**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a relationship between wine quality and the predictor variables (alcohol, sulphates, volatile acidity)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🍷 **Alcohol, sulphates, and volatile acidity** are the strongest predictors of wine quality.\n",
    "- The model explains a **statistically significant portion** of variation in ratings, though not all — subjective taste remains a factor.\n",
    "- **High VIF values** were detected among several chemical variables, indicating **multicollinearity** (some predictors are strongly correlated).\n",
    "  - This means coefficients should be interpreted with caution — while significant relationships exist, their *independent effects* are less certain.\n",
    "- Residual plots suggest no major violations of linearity or homoscedasticity, but slight heteroscedasticity was observed at higher fitted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Model Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Quality = 2.57 + 0.31(Alcohol) + 0.68(Sulphates) - 1.24(Volatile\\ Acidity)\n",

    "| Variable | Coefficient | Interpretation |\n",
    "|:--|:--|:--|\n",
    "| **Alcohol** | +0.31 | Higher alcohol content generally increases perceived quality |\n",
    "| **Sulphates** | +0.68 | Wines with higher sulphate levels tend to score higher |\n",
    "| **Volatile Acidity** | −1.24 | Higher volatile acidity (vinegary aroma) lowers perceived quality |\n",
